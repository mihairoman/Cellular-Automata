# Cellular-Automata

Experimenting with cellular automata concept.
Didn't have to be a NodeJs app, just wanted to play with Node (as I am new to it) and deploying
applications to Heroku.

Implemented rule: 73

Other rules: http://atlas.wolfram.com/01/01/

Heroku link: http://cell-automata.herokuapp.com

Future improvements : 
  - implementation of multiple sets of rules (generate the one selected by the user)
  - take the generation script out of index.html
